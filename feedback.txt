Task 1:
A.	 
In exercise Sheet 5 I could not implement the task 1.C i.e to play melody 1 for one knock and melody 2 for two knocks. So, I spent some time to implement that task.
Because, Exercise sheet 6 has its continuity. 

The challenge was only to understand how the relay can be used to switch between two functionalities of piezo element in the code.

Please open the Hterm to see how many times you are knocking.  

B.
	 
For this it was all theory questions. So, I have tried to explain everything in detail in another text file (Task-1b)  attached.
